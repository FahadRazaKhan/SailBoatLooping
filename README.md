# SailBoatLooping
This Program is used to make Autonomous Zig-Zag Looping of Hybrid SailBoat.

This program is for performing continous Autonomous loops (Open-loop) of a
Hybrid Sailboat. It also measures and then stores the Current Sensor values in
an XLSX file. Looping and Current measuring functions run on two different threads
simultaneously.
